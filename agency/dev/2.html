The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</h2><h3>Pittsburgh Web Design</h3><h2>Web Development</h2><h2>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications (or just 'web apps') electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of content management systems or CMS. These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary or open source. In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware between the database and the user through the browser. A principle benefit of a CMS is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their web site without having technical knowledge. For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers deal with the layout and visuals of a website, while back-end developers deal with the functionality of a website. Back-end developers will program in the functions of a website that will collect data.</h2><h3>Pittsburgh Web Development</h3><h2>Search engine optimization (SEO)</h2><h2>Search engine optimization (SEO) (Long-Term Digital Marketing) is the process of affecting the online visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a website appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers.[1] SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search,[2] news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. SEO differs from local search engine optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products or services. The former instead is more focused on national or international searches. As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer programmed algorithms which dictate search engine behavior, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, adding content, doing HTML, and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic. By May 2015, mobile search had surpassed desktop search.[3] In 2015, it was reported that Google is developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products. In response, many brands are beginning to take a different approach to their Internet marketing strategies.</h2><h3>Pittsburgh SEO</h3><h2>Internet Marketing and Online Advertising</h2><h2>Online advertising, also called online marketing or Internet advertising or web advertising, is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers. Consumers view online advertising as an unwanted distraction with few benefits and have increasingly turned to ad blocking for a variety of reasons. It includes email marketing, search engine marketing (SEM), social media marketing (SMM), many types of display advertising (including web banner advertising), and mobile advertising. Like other advertising media, online advertising frequently involves both a publisher, who integrates advertisements into its online content, and an advertiser, who provides the advertisements to be displayed on the publisher's content. Other potential participants include advertising agencies who help generate and place the ad copy, an ad server which technologically delivers the ad and tracks statistics, and advertising affiliates who do independent promotional work for the advertiser. In 2016, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of cable television and broadcast television. In 2017, Internet advertising revenues in the United States totaled $83.0 billion, a 14% increase over the $72.50 billion in revenues in 2016. Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation. Online ad revenues may not adequately replace other publishers' revenue streams. Declining ad revenue has led some publishers to hide their content behind paywalls.</h2><h3>Pittsburgh Digital Agency</h3><h2>Social Media Marketing</h2><h2>Social media marketing (Short-Term Digital Marketing) is the use of social media platforms and websites to promote a product or service. Although the terms e-marketing and digital marketing are still dominant in academia, social media marketing is becoming more popular for both practitioners and researchers. Most social media platforms have built-in data analytics tools, which enable companies to track the progress, success, and engagement of ad campaigns. Companies address a range of stakeholders through social media marketing, including current and potential customers, current and potential employees, journalists, bloggers, and the general public. On a strategic level, social media marketing includes the management of a marketing campaign, governance, setting the scope (e.g. more active or passive use) and the establishment of a firm's desired social media "culture" and "tone." When using social media marketing, firms can allow customers and Internet users to post user-generated content (e.g., online comments, product reviews, etc.), also known as "earned media," rather than use marketer-prepared advertising copy.</h2><h3>Pittsburgh Social Media Agency</h3><h2>Mobile App Development</h2><h2>Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a Web browser. Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms. Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. A 2013 analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU 28 members, 60% of which are mobile app developers. As part of the development process, mobile user interface (UI) design is also essential in the creation of mobile apps. Mobile UI considers constraints, contexts, screen, input, and mobility as outlines for design. The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation. Mobile UI design constraints include limited attention and form factors, such as a mobile device's screen size for a user's hand(s). Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user activity, such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within a mobile app. Overall, mobile UI design's goal is mainly for an understandable, user-friendly interface. The UI of mobile apps should: consider users' limited attention, minimize keystrokes, and be task-oriented with a minimum set of functions. This functionality is supported by mobile enterprise application platforms or integrated development environments (IDEs). Mobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile back-ends to support access to enterprise systems. The mobile back-end facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, working off-line, and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components including mobile app server, mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), and service-oriented architecture (SOA) infrastructure.</h2><h3>Pittsburgh Mobile App Development</h3><h2>Mobile Web App Development</h2><h2>Web application development is the process and practice of developing web applications. Just as with a traditional desktop application, web applications have varying levels of risk. A personal home page is much less risky than, for example, a stock trading web site. For some projects security, software bugs, etc. are major issues. If time to market, or technical complexity is a concern, documentation, test planning, change control, requirements analysis, architectural description and formal design and construction practices can mitigate risk. In the case of ASP.NET, developers can use Microsoft Visual Studio to write code. But, as with most other programming languages, they can also use a text editor (Notepad++ for example). WebORB Integration Server for .NET can be used to integrate .NET services, data and media with any web client. It includes developer-productivity tools and APIs for remoting, messaging and data management. For ColdFusion and the related open-source CFML engines, there are several tools available for writing code. These include Adobe Dreamweaver CS4, the CFEclipse plugin for Eclipse (software) and Adobe CF Builder. One can also use any text editor, such as Notepad++ or TextEdit. Many tools support the Java programming language. The most popular include Apache Tomcat, GlassFish, JDeveloper and Netbeans, but there are numerous others. For PHP, the Zend Development Environment provides numerous debugging tools and provides a rich feature-set to make PHP development easier. WebORB Integration Server for PHP can be used to integrate PHP classes and data with any web client. It includes developer productivity tools and APIs for remoting, messaging and data management. Tools such as Hammerkit abstract PHP into a visual programming environment and utilise component-based software methods to accelerate development.</h2><h3>Mobile Web App Development</h3><h2>What is a Digital Agency</h2><h2>In a world where marketing and advertising is now primarily digital, the term ‘digital agency’ almost seems redundant, doesn’t it? However, with print, radio, television, and other traditional marketing techniques maintaining some relevance among modern strategic marketing campaigns, explaining what makes a ‘digital agency’ different than some others out there is something we think our readers should understand. have the tools and skills necessary to create ideas and assets and put them to work in the most efficient ways. A digital agency’s focus goes beyond just the aesthetics of design, but also considers the overall user experience on every digital platform, and regardless of what type of device is being used. From web development and UX/UI web design to SEO, social media and content marketing – and everything in between – a digital agency works to deliver a functional design that not only looks great, but also drives business growth. Digital agencies also tend to specialize in a specific area of digital marketing/advertising, in a particular niche market, a general business size or type, or an otherwise specified client base. By doing this, they hire for a specific skillset, and obtain more experience in a focused area vs. trying to be everything to everyone. It’s nearly impossible for a modern marketing and/or advertising agency to completely ignore the digital side of the industry, which means most successful agencies consider themselves to be both creative and digital. However, it’s where the agency’s passion, focus, and experience lies that ultimately makes the difference.</h2><h3>Pittsburgh Digital Agency</h3><h2>The Digital Advantage</h2><h2>A digital agency understands the value of investing in advanced technology, as well as in highly skilled web developers, programmers, digital marketing professionals and SEO experts. With advanced skills and technology at their fingertips, a digital agency can offer multiple digital solutions to their clients, along with traditional creative design and branding services. We discussed the value of customization – which is commonly practiced among digital agencies, stating that, “By establishing and maintaining a partnership with their clients, digital agencies find it easier to customize a strategy built around trust and respect. Whether it is a web development project or a marketing campaign, everything is specialized to fit specific demands. This is a far different business approach from the traditional client/agency paradigm.”</h2><h3>The Best Digital Agency</h3><h2>The Best Social Media Agency in Pittsburgh</h2><h2>We implement the most disruptive whitehat methods on the social media industry and have helped create the social media marketing industry in Pittsburgh through our kindness and care for our customers.

After some research we decided to give DAI Builds a chance. We are incredibly happy with the results, Roberto is incredibly knowledgeable and re-built our website from scratch, implementing a great responsive web design, along some local-focused SEO that we are paying month to month, and data analytics. It loads incredibly fast and our customers are really happy with it now. DAI Builds is a small business that is handled by only 4 people, while they may take a little longer than bigger brands in Pittsburgh, they make sure to take care of you from 0 to 100, and guide you along the way. Thank you again!</p></div><div class="review-item"><div class="review-meta"><span class="review-author">Phil Moore</span><span class="review-sep">, </span><span class="review-date">Jul 8, 2018</span></div><div class="review-stars"><ul><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li></ul></div><p class="review-text">One of our clients needed a responsive web design for their website and we decided to give DAI Builds a try. Roberto was great to work with, he prepared a thorough yet simple estimate for the website design. He also suggested a few other things that we might need in regards to SEO, Digital Marketing, Social Media Integration, Web Analytics, etc. The website is great, it loads truly fast compared to our main website, the content is captivating as well and we are seeing some traction already. We are currently discussing working with them again but this time on our main business' website as it may need some revamping. Truly pleased, thanks again!</p></div><div class="review-item"><div class="review-meta"><span class="review-author">Richard Tiernay</span><span class="review-sep">, </span><span class="review-date">Jun 21, 2018</span></div><div class="review-stars"><ul><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li></ul></div><p class="review-text">We hired DAI Builds for SEO purposes for 3 of our websites, and they have always exceeded our expectations.  They are the most open company I have ever had the opportunity to work with in how they want you to try to understand their profession just as much as them, that way everyone can be contributing all the time.  They have no destructive egos, and they are by far the most logical/competent Search Engine Optimization consultants I have ever met.  Too many consultants tend to get caught up in heavy granular activity, which eventually pulls you away from the big picture, DAI Builds always has the big picture in mind, and they know the roads to get there.</p></div><div class="review-item"><div class="review-meta"><span class="review-author">William Smith</span><span class="review-sep">, </span><span class="review-date">Jun 21, 2018</span></div><div class="review-stars"><ul><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li></ul></div><p class="review-text">I can't say enough good things about working with DAI Builds to design our new company's website.  From taking the time to understand our company's vision, goals and long-term approach - to concept generation, strenuous testing to launch, the whole process was first class. Their process is very well organized and there we no surprises in time-scope or pricing.  In particular the owner Roberto, he was amazing to work with. He is extremely knowledgeable, responsive, kind and courteous, and he pushes all the right buttons to keep things on track. We have other web-based projects in the pipeline and will definitely be using DAI Builds for our SEO and Web Design needs again.</p></div><div class="review-item"><div class="review-meta"><span class="review-author">Tina Aiello</span><span class="review-sep">, </span><span class="review-date">Jun 18, 2018</span></div><div class="review-stars"><ul><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li><li><i class="star"></i></li></ul></div><p class="review-text">DAI Builds will give you the best Whitehat SEO results in Pittsburgh.
